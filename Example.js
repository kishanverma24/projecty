  // Project 10: Autonomous Drone Delivery System
  {
    id: "10",
    title: "Autonomous Drone Delivery System",
    overview:
      "A system that uses autonomous drones to deliver small packages to customers, reducing delivery times and increasing efficiency for e-commerce businesses.",
    description:
      "Current delivery methods can be slow and costly, especially in urban areas. This system aims to offer a faster, cost-effective alternative using drones to autonomously deliver packages to customers.",
    objective:
      "To create a fully autonomous drone delivery system that handles logistics, flight planning, and real-time tracking to ensure timely and efficient deliveries.",
